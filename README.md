This is a website for creating 3 Odin Recipes I selected:
Lasagna, Elote Ramen Noodles and Mexican Tinga. 
The homepage is index.html which has the links to these three recipes in an unordered list so navigating to these webpages is quite easy. Once readers reach the end of the web page, they can easily click on the back to homepage link to return to homepage and choose another linked recipe to visit.

Making this website as a beginner was a refresher and I do feel I have learned a lot and slowly beginning to feel less anxious about learning web development.
